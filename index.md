### PhD Student | Single Cell Genomics, Bioinformatics, AI/ML

I am an Integrative Life Sciences PhD student at Virginia Commonwealth University with experience in single-cell genomic method development, multi-omic data integration, computational biology, and precision medicine. I am a member of the Biological Networks Laboratory in the VCU Department of Computer Science, under the supervision of Dr. Preetam Ghosh. This website serves as a resource to list my current research, archive previous projects, and connect with other researchers.
