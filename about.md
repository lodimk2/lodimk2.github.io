## About Me

I am an Integrative Life Sciences PhD student at Virginia Commonwealth University with experience in single-cell genomic method development, multi-omic data integration, computational biology, and precision medicine. I am a member of the Biological Networks Laboratory in the VCU Department of Computer Science, under the supervision of Dr. Preetam Ghosh.

I also enjoy playing cricket recreationally, in addition to reading fiction novels, and listening/playing all types of music.
